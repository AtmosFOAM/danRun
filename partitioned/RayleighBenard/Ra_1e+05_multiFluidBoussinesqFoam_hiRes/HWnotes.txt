Hilary's notes on test case
partitioned/RayleighBenard/Ra_1e+05_multiFluidBoussinesqFoam_hiRes

Problem: no slip boundary conditions are not maintained.
~~~~~~~

Run for just one time step and write out.

For setting the initial conditions, copy file contents rather than links using:
cp -L init_0/* 0

That seems to fix the writing out problem, but does it fix the problem in the code? Try running for longer.

Problem: Velocity and pressure jump at bottom corner in first time step
~~~~~~~
Need to use hydrostatic boundary condition for P rather than zero gradient.
Yes, I have come across this issue. It took me ages to solve. I ended up creating the hydrostatic pressure boundary condition.
